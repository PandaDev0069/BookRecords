### Testing Commands

```bash
# Development
npm test                  # Watch mode for unit tests
npm run test:ci          # CI mode with coverage
npm run test:e2e         # Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:ui      # E2E tests with visual UI
npm run test:e2e:debug   # Debug E2E tests

# Coverage
npm run test:ci          # Generates coverage report
# View: open coverage/lcov-report/index.html

# Debugging in VS Code
# Press F5, select:
# - "Jest: Run All Tests"
# - "Jest: Debug Current Test File"
# - "Playwright: Debug E2E Tests"
```

## 🔧 VS Code Integration

### Debug Configurations

Located in `.vscode/launch.json`:

1. **Next.js: debug server-side** - Debug the dev server
2. **Next.js: debug client-side** - Debug in Chrome
3. **Next.js: debug full stack** - Debug both
4. **Jest: Run All Tests** - Run all unit tests with debugger
5. **Jest: Debug Current Test File** - Debug specific test file
6. **Playwright: Debug E2E Tests** - Debug E2E tests

### How to Use

1. Open test file
2. Set breakpoints by clicking line numbers
3. Press `F5`
4. Select debug configuration
5. Step through code with debugger controls

## 🎓 Testing Best Practices Implemented

1. **Isolated Tests** - Each test is independent
2. **Descriptive Names** - Clear test descriptions
3. **AAA Pattern** - Arrange, Act, Assert
4. **Mock External Dependencies** - localStorage mocked
5. **Test Edge Cases** - Null checks, overdue dates, etc.
6. **Fast Tests** - Unit tests run in ~5 seconds
7. **Deterministic** - Tests use fixed dates
8. **Maintainable** - Well-organized test structure

## 🔍 What's Tested

### ✅ Fully Tested

- Date utilities (formatDate, isOverdue, getDaysUntil)
- Daily goal calculator
- Stats component rendering
- BookCard component behavior
- User interactions (buttons, clicks)
- Progress calculations
- Status badges and warnings

### ⚠️ Partially Tested

- BookForm component (covered by E2E, not unit tests)
- Main page component (covered by E2E)
- localStorage operations (mocked, but tested)

### 📋 Coverage Goals

- Current: 65% utilities, 92% BookCard, 100% Stats
- Goal: 80%+ overall coverage
- Focus: Add BookForm component tests
